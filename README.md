## Introduction

Welcome to my comprehensive collection of LeetCode problems and Python programming solutions. This repository serves as both a personal archive of my coding journey and a resource for fellow programmers seeking to improve their problem-solving skills.

Each solution is meticulously documented with:
- Problem statement and constraints
- Approach explanation with reasoning
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Edge cases consideration
- Alternative solutions where applicable

Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, improving your algorithmic thinking, or simply looking to practice Python programming, this repository aims to be a valuable resource in your learning journey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual problem directories, each containing:

1. **Problem **: A  problem name
2. **Solution Files**: Implementation of the solution in Python

## Solution Approach

My solutions generally follow these principles:

1. **Readability First**: Clean, well-commented code that's easy to understand
2. **Efficiency**: Optimized for both time and space complexity
3. **Pythonic**: Leveraging Python's built-in features and best practices
4. **Multiple Approaches**: When relevant, providing both brute force and optimized solutions
5. **Edge Cases**: Careful handling of boundary conditions and special inputs

## How to Use This Repository

## Implementation Details

Most solutions are implemented in Python 3, taking advantage of:
- Collections module (Counter, defaultdict, etc.)
- List comprehensions
- Generator expressions
- Standard library functions
- Type hints (in newer solutions)

## Time & Space Complexity Analysis

Each solution includes a detailed analysis of:
- **Time Complexity**: Big O notation explaining the running time
- **Space Complexity**: Additional memory requirements
- **Optimization Considerations**: Trade-offs between time and space
